# Capstone Starter Project

## Database

Inside the `<project-root>/database/` directory, you'll find an executable Bash script (`.sh` file) and several SQL scripts (`.sql` files). These can be used to build and rebuild a PostgreSQL database for the capstone project.

From a terminal session, execute the following commands:

```
cd <project-root>/database/
./create.sh
```

This Bash script drops the existing database, if necessary, creates a new database named `final_capstone`, and runs the various SQL scripts in the correct order. You don't need to modify the Bash script unless you want to change the database name.

Each SQL script has a specific purpose as described here:

| File Name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `data.sql` | This script populates the database with any static setup data or test/demo data. The project team should modify this script. |
| `dropdb.sql` | This script destroys the database so that it can be recreated. It drops the database and associated users. The project team shouldn't have to modify this script. |
| `schema.sql` | This script creates all of the database objects, such as tables and sequences. The project team should modify this script. |
| `user.sql` | This script creates the database application users and grants them the appropriate privileges. The project team shouldn't have to modify this script. <br /> See the next section for more information on these users. |

### Database users

The database superuser—meaning `postgres`—must only be used for database administration. It must not be used by applications. As such, two database users are created for the capstone application to use as described here:

| Username | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `final_capstone_owner` | This user is the schema owner. It has full access—meaning granted all privileges—to all database objects within the `capstone` schema and also has privileges to create new schema objects. This user can be used to connect to the database from PGAdmin for administrative purposes. |
| `final_capstone_appuser` | The application uses this user to make connections to the database. This user is granted `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` privileges for all database tables and can `SELECT` from all sequences. The application datasource has been configured to connect using this user. |


## Spring Boot
Note: Spring Boot has been configured to run on port `9000` for this project. You might be used to port `8080` from earlier in the cohort, but it's changed so as not to conflict with the Vue server that you'll be running concurrently.

### Datasource

A Datasource has been configured for you in `/src/resources/application.properties`. It connects to the database using the `capstone_appuser` database user. You can change the name of this database if you want, but remember to change it here and in the `create.sh` script in the database folder:

```
# datasource connection properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/final_capstone
spring.datasource.name=final_capstone
spring.datasource.username=final_capstone_appuser
spring.datasource.password=finalcapstone
```

### JdbcTemplate

If you look in `/src/main/java/com/techelevator/dao`, you'll see `JdbcUserDao`. This is an example of how to get an instance of `JdbcTemplate` in your DAOs. If you declare a field of type `JdbcTemplate` and add it as an argument to the constructor, Spring automatically injects an instance for you:

```java
@Service
public class JdbcUserDao implements UserDao {

    private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

    public JdbcUserDao(JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate) {
        this.jdbcTemplate = jdbcTemplate;
    }
}
```

### CORS

Any controller that'll be accessed from a client like the Vue Starter application needs the `@CrossOrigin` annotation. This
tells the browser that you're allowing the client application to access this resource:

```java
@RestController
@CrossOrigin
public class AuthenticationController {
    // ...
}
```

## Security

Most of the functionality related to Security is located in the `/src/main/java/com/techelevator/security` package. You shouldn't have to modify anything here, but feel free to go through the code if you want to see how things work.

### Authentication Controller

There is a single controller in the `com.techelevator.controller` package called `AuthenticationController.java`.

This controller contains the `/login` and `/register` routes and works with the Vue starter as is. If you need to modify the user registration form, start here.

The authentication controller uses the `JdbcUserDao` to read and write data from the users table.


## Testing


### DAO integration tests

`com.techelevator.dao.BaseDaoTests` has been provided for you to use as a base class for any DAO integration test. It initializes a Datasource for testing and manages rollback of database changes between tests.

`com.techelevator.dao.JdbUserDaoTests` has been provided for you as an example for writing your own DAO integration tests.

Remember that when testing, you're using a copy of the real database. The schema and data for the test database are defined within `/src/test/resources/test-data.sql`.
